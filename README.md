PROJECT 1: DATA CAMP CO2 EMISSION MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

PROBLEM STATEMENT

CHALLENGE 1: 

Gain insights on the type of vehicles that have lower CO2 emissions. 

Include:

The median engine size in liters?

The average fuel consumption for regular gasoline (Fuel Type = X), premium gasoline (Z), ethanol (E), and diesel (D)?

The correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?

Which vehicle class has lower average CO2 emissions?

The average CO2 emissions for all vehicles? For vehicles with an engine size of 2.0 liters or smaller?


CHALLENGE 2: 

What is the most expensive item your company sells? The least expensive?

How many different products of each category does your company sell?

What are the top three brands with the highest average list price? The top three categories?

Predict CO2 Emissions using Machine Learning model.

Any other insights you found during your analysis?


In conclusion, this projects goes from Data Cleaning to Exploratory Data Analysis to Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning.
